# # Some of the features of tuple are as follows:

# #     Tuples are ordered
# #     Tuples index starts with 0
# #     Tuples can have more than one data types
# #     Tuples can have non-unique items
# #     Tuples can not be changed or modified once initialized
# #     Tuples are represented by small brackets () instead of []
# #     Tuples are faster than lists
